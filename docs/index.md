# Welcome to PipeDev

This is where I document everything I learn about Computer Science — from the first bit to AI.

If you’re new to PipeDev, start with the [About](about.md) page to understand what this project is about.

Otherwise, head to [Learn](learn/index.md) and choose the topic you want to explore.
