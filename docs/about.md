PipeDev is a long-term project dedicated to understanding how computers really work — from the bit to Artificial Intelligence.

It’s not a company or a channel. It’s a journey of building systems from first principles:  
writing compilers, databases, operating systems, and small experimental tools to reveal the layers that make software possible.

Every article, project, and line of code shared here comes from that goal:  
to make Computer Science clear, logical, and beautiful again.

### Who’s behind it

PipeDev is created and maintained by an engineer who prefers to stay behind the scenes for now.  
This is not about personality or fame — it’s about the craft, the ideas, and the systems themselves.

When the time is right, the story behind PipeDev will be told.  
For now, the work speaks first.

### What you’ll find here

- **Learn** — a living repository of everything I study, from binary and Turing machines to distributed systems and AI.  
- **Projects** — real systems I’m building: PipeLang, PipeDB, PipeOS, and others.  
- **Philosophy** — the principles behind this entire journey.

If you ever feel lost in modern Computer Science —  
I hope something here helps you see the structure behind the chaos.
